	EAGLE BEAT, ENTER RUINED CASTLE(2-7)========================================================================
The Great Eagle chokes, freezes up, and slowly drops onto the mountainside.
You can hear the awful noises it makes as it tumbles off the rocks.
You don't have time to mourn; the bandits must still be moving.
Scrambling back up the rockside, the ruins the bandits took refuge inside of isn't too far away.
You make it inside after a few minutes, and take a breath outside.
They're trapped like rats in a barrel, now - time to strike.
	LORE 1(9-13)==========================================================================================================
You quickly find that there is something deathly wrong with these ruins.
There is a fell presence about, and many of the bandits have already been killed by the demons.
There is only one set of ruins along the Grand Line possessed by demons.
Your stomach sinks as you realise that you are in it. If Jarl is in here, too, you have even less time.
Someone must have summoned this demonic host, though, right? There is no time to make guesses, though.
	LORE 2(15, 19)==========================================================================================================
Dread fills your mind as you realise that this is no minor 'summoning'. Whoever has conjured this demon host is serious.
They haven't just brought a few demons over, they've opened the gates. Demons will continue to pour out, until they are stopped.
You are beginning to realise why the King adressed you with such a dire expression.
If this was their goal from the start, then stopping them now was all the more vital.
If the summoner continues to hold the door open for these monsters, the Empire will be overrun.
	LORE 3(21-26)==========================================================================================================
You spot an encampment of bandits, holed out to protect from the demon infestation. For now, you can listen in.
'Fuck, this wasn't in the plan, was it?' One has his head in his hands, his blade covered in the familiar demon-blood your own sword is caked in.
'Jarl said we don't have time to ask the West for help, but--' One man grunts as he lashes out at a shadow mistaken for a demon.
'--But we didn't need to swamp the bloody place in demons!' 
'At least this'll teach the bloody empire for trying to stomp on us.' Another man with a Southern accent.
These aren't bandits - they're just a Southern militia. And this wasn't a kidnapping.
	BOSS PREP(PRE-DRAKE)(28-30)======================================================================================
It's even worse than you had imagined. A hell-drake rears it's head, and you know instinctively just how strong it is.
You barely even have time to run; it's eyes are on you in an instant, licking a plasma-like drool from it's lips.
This will be the hardest fight of your career, or your last.
	DRAKE DEAD - SWORD CHOICE(32-36)==========================================================================================
You're panting, barely able to lift your sword. Unsurprisingly, a hell-drake is a tough cookie to break.
But you've won; the drake is melting away, it's form becoming a slew of goop, and eventually leaving nothing but the insides of it's guts.
This particular drake must have eaten half-a-dozen travelling hoarders since it was last killed.
From inside it's stomach sack, a set of five swords come tumbling out, all in shockingly pristine condition.
You toss your own blade aside, and go to pick one up. Finally, a lucky break.
	PRE-BOSS - JARL(NOT LORE)(38-42)====================================================================================================
With the drake taken down, and your new sword at your hip, you move ahead.
Jarl isn't far away, and it seems the summoner has escaped after you took down the drake.
'Jarl!' You rush to your appentice's side, but grimace as he forces you away.
There is a grim look on his face. You don't know why, but his dagger is already drawn.
Something tells you that you ought to do the same.
	POST-BOSS - JARL(NOT LORE)(44-50)=================================================================================================
You strike down Jarl, and he falls hard against the rocks. Over the course of your fight, you've come to realise he isn't an ally.
'Damn--' Jarl turns back to you, his face a bloody mess. 'You've got no idea what's going on, do you?'
'I know you just tried to kill me.' You could point out a dozen killing strikes Jarl just directed at your heart.
'So be it, then. Finish me off, puppet.'
You do exactly that, leaving Jarl's corpse with an unpleasant look on his face.
The kind of expression that would conjure up a ghost; unfinished business.
You will have a lot of explaining to the King, but you figure the job is done.
	PRE-BOSS - JARL(LORE)(52-58)==============================================================================================
With the hell-drake taken down, and your new sword at your hip, you move ahead.
You find Jarl after a minute or two of searching, looking weak and drained.
No doubt the summoning ritual took a lot out of him. You wonder if you should kill him now, or wait for him to get up.
'Ugh...' Jarl sighs, realising his plan has come undone. 'You don't understand anything, do you?'
You understand enough. 'I am a knight of the Empire. It is my job to protect it.'
Jarl smiles, and it seems he's had enough for questions. He draws his blade.
'Your Empire isn't what you think it is. That King is treating you like a puppet.'
	POST-BOSS - JARL(LORE)(60-69)=============================================================================================	
Jarl coughs out blood as you draw it from him. You know his fighting style like a script - because you taught it to him.
'Well, you're a bloody strong puppet...' He realises he's lost. 'Even in the Fens, you cut us down like we were twigs.'
Jarl brings up his necklace; an emblem of the Southern Defenders. So, they were spying on you in the South.
You can't decide - is Jarl a traitor, or were you being tricked the whole time?
'The Empire just rolls over people like us.' You step back, and let the wounded man explain himself.
'Your King is planning on expanding into the South, and there's nothing we can do to stop him. We couldn't stop you, either.'
'I was going to request help from the West, but, well...' He groans, dropping his sword to clutch his chest.
You take the time to consider your options. You've chased down and executed a group of messengers.
You can let them go, and complete their mission - perhaps the Empire will pull out of their conquest.
Or, you could finish Jarl off, and have the Empire quietly choke the South out, with no-one to stop them.
	BOSS KILLED(71-74)=======================================================================================================
You've done this much already; might at least finish your job.
You finish Jarl off with a single flick of your sword - this new blade is doing wonders.
The King will knight you, and you won't even notice as the fertile lands of the South are trodden down.
Perhaps the Empire will prosper. At least you can pat yourself on the back for that.
	BOSS LET GO(SECRET ENDING)(76-83)=======================================================================================================
You share a health potion with Jarl, and help him up. 'This never happened.' You still have a soft spot for your apprentice.
Jarl nods. He knows just how far you've stuck your neck out for him, and his little country.
'It will be our secret. Although I doubt we will meet again, I shan't forget this' Jarl catches his breath as the health potion works it's magic.
'Consider this your last lesson.' You reach out your hand to shake Jarl, who takes it slowly.
With this, the West will pressure the Empire into keeping it's hands off the South.
Perhaps a world-wide war will break out. Perhaps the King will be executed.
Your future is unsure, but you can't shake the feeling that Jarl will make the right choice.
He is your apprentice, after all - hopefully he'll grow into a better Knight than you were.

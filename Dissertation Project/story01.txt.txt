	OPENING (2-10) ====================================================================================
'Welcome back,' the King greets you with an easy smile as you enter the court, the guards merely giving you a cursory glance before they let you pass.
Your reputation precedes you, as close friend of the King's, and one of the Empire's up-and-coming knights.
Kneeling before the monarch, you crack a smile; it's only been a few months since his coronation.
The new King seems to be fit for the role.
In fact, you left for your last quest only a few weeks after the coronation, so you've hardly had any time to see him at work.
The King seems to catch your sentiment. 'Unfortunately, you have no time to rest.' He begins, and your heart sinks.
'In fact, I don't even have time to knight you for your successes.'
Another tough pill to swallow. All that trouble in the Southern Fens was for nothing.
You raise your head in question, and the King continues. 'You have a new quest.'
	OPENING 2(11-21)=======================================================================================
'My quest, my lord?' You have to force yourself to remember to add the honorific.
The King doesn't  seem to mind. 'A great many things has happened in your vacancy,'
You're almost ready for a lecture, but the tone in the King's voice tells you this is urgent.
'One of those things being the dissapearance of your apprentice, Ser Jarl.' You're sick to your stomach.
As you stand to press the King for answers, he raises his hand to quell your anger.
'I understand your confusion.' The King's voice is as calm and considered as ever.
You are almost worried by his blank expression - wasn't Jarl his friend, too?
'We have reason to believe Jarl has been taken east, to the edges of our Kingdom.' Standing, the King leaves his throne.
He approaches the great World Map that decorates the floor of the throne room, pointing to the east of the Empire with his cane.
'If he is taken outside of the border, I will not be able to protect you.' The King turns serious.
'In the case that you are unable to catch up, return at once.' He insists, and you can't help but wonder what is going on.
	OPENING 3(23-28)===================================================================================================
Packing light, you bring only the necessities. The King's orders were to leave at once, and you couldn't agree more.
Your sword comes too, but it is battered from the dirty work in the Southern Fens - a new one would be useful.
Setting out, the first major obstacle in your path is a shortcut through Gamor's Cave, a den of demi-humans that prey on travellers.
You decide to make the risky shortcut through the cave, and use lethal force if necessary.
Well, you suppose they've had this coming for a while.
	ENTERING CAVE(30-32)===================================================================================
As you expected, Gamor's Cave isn't a pleasant place. Demi-humans are mostly nocturnal, so it's almost pitch black.
You figure that if they're nocturnal, you might be able to sneak through undetected. Perhaps you could find some treasure, too?
You shake your head; you've got to hurry, to save Ser Jarl, right?
	EXIT CAVE(34-39)=======================================================================================
You've been in that dank, smelly cave for almost an hour now, so the clean air smells like the finest of sweets.
Your sword has only grown duller from the fights you had down in the cave.
You can hardly use it to chop apart the greenery, now...
Pushing apart some branches, you find yourself in an open field, a forest a few miles ahead.
Looming behind those trees is the Grand Line, the mountain range that exists as the formal border between the Empire and it's neighbour.
You imagine that that is where Jarl's captors are aiming for. You've caught up, but the chase continues.
	LORE 1(41-48)===========================================================================================
Searching through the cave, you come along what might be considered a 'bedroom'. A 'dorm', at least.
There are piles of trash everywhere, both stolen goods and random garbage.
But, your eyes catch on a book.
Your curiosity gets the best of you, and you flip it open.
From the dates scrawled at the top of each page, you assume it's a diary. One written in Guinese.
You can't read Giunese, but you can recognise it; because everything in the south is written in it.
Whoever is living in these caves, they must've had a role in the Southern Fens.
You grin, telling yourself they were lucky to miss you.
	LORE 2(50-52)===========================================================================================
Kicking apart a few crates in your way, you discover something familiar drop from the detritus that falls out.
It's the sheath for Jarl's sword! Picking it up, you carefully stash it away.
So, the King wasn't just sending you on a wild-goose chase. With renewed fervour, you hurry on.
	LORE 3(54-59)===========================================================================================
Attracted by a sickly-sweet smell, you approach a large chamber.
No enemies, thankfully, but stacks upon stacks of crates. The smell is getting overwhelming.
Prying one open carefully, you brace yourself for whatever might be in there.
Mysteriously, you find a stash of myneberries. These kind of berries are only grown in the far south.
In fact, not far from where you were working in the Fens. You take a moment to wonder how they got here.
And then, of course, take one for yourself. Nothing wrong with a snack.
	BOSS - BANDIT(61-65)=========================================================================================
Arriving at the forest, you come across a small campfire; it's fresh.
Kicking about the ashes and looking for a way to track your change, you hear a voice behind you.
'Ah, crud...' Turning to face them, you see a dishevelled man with a poison-laced sword.
'This is what I get for wakin' up late...' He grumbles, levelling his blade at you.
You respond in kind.
	ENTER FOREST(67-72)====================================================================================
The bandit falls to the floor with a wet thunk, face-down in the mud.
You realise you should have questioned him, shouldn't you?
The time spent dragging questions out of him would be time wasted on catching up, though.
No use beating yourself up, though; the forest looms up, the trees a great deal larger than you remember.
Glancing at your sword, you find it's started to chip.
This might be tough.
	EXIT FOREST(74-80)==========================================================================================
The forest's canopy has grown so thick you can hardly see a few feet ahead.
You must have caught it in a bad mood.
Fortunately, though, a shaft of light breaks through, and illuminates the exit.
Hurrying through, you kick apart the shrubbery and burst, gasping, into the open air.
As expected, the Grand Line mountain range hangs above.
If you squint, you can see a group of people moving through the crags.
Wiping your blade clean, blood and goop sloshes onto the floor. You prepare yourself for the climb.
	EAGLE ENCOUNTER(82-87)====================================================================================
The figures above are assaulted by a gigantic eagle; the protector of this flank of the Grand Line.
You curse as you look about for a hiding spot. The party is fortunate, dashing inside a nearby ruin.
You, however, not so much. After clawing at the entrance to the ruins for a moment, the eagle gives up.
And looks down at you.
You scramble onto a sturdy-enough ledge, and draw your sword.
There isn't much room to swing your sword - perhaps some magic would work against this beast.
	LORE 4(89-94) ============================================================================================
You're quickly realising this forest isn't very fun. Hardly a forest, and more like a jungle.
Fortunately, you can use the brush to hide from some of the less pleasant enemies.
One of these such enemies is another bandit from the camp you just passed, trudging through the undergrowth just like you.
'Damn, this place stinks...' he mutters, his accent identical to the last bandit you encountered.
'That ruddy Jarl doesn't wait for anyone, does he? I'll stick his ass if I see 'im again'
Your brow creases, and the bandit dissapears before you can work up the courage to accost him.
	LORE 5(96-100) ============================================================================================
Barely missing the eyes of a Beastman, you duck under a nearby shrub and cover your mouth.
Beastmen are attuned to heat-levels, so you can only thank the stars that it's so awfully hot today.
Regardless, you can't help but wonder why a Beastman would be in this neck of the Empire.
Every year, they migrate from the warmer south to the north, to escape the heat, but this is far too early.
It seems, ever since your mission in the Fens, everyone has lost their mind.
	LORE 6(102-106)============================================================================================
You're trudging through a lighter patch of overgrowth when you catch something out of the corner of your eye.
A large fruit, ripe and about to drop from a tree. You must have forgotten the season thanks to your busy schedule.
Early Autumn; the forest's fruit must just have been harvested by hungry travellers. You're lucky to find one left over.
You don't want to stop - you have important business - but when the fruit drops straight from the branch, you can't help but catch it.
A lucky break, a nice change of pace from the rest of this awful forest.
	LORE 7 (108-111)============================================================================================
You can feel from the fresher air that the forest is thinning out. Ahead, the Grand Line awaits.
You try to remember the last time you were there. It's the fastest route to the Western Kingdom, but...
It's not reccomended. The place is surrounded by rumors, mythos and bad omens.
Considering that the forest is this riled up, for some terrible reason, you only imagine the Grand Line will be worse.
